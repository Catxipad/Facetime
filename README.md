# Facetime - Does not work
This Python script is designed to automate the process of making calls using FaceTime on macOS. It uses the pynput library to simulate keyboard inputs and the built-in 'open' command on macOS to start FaceTime and make a call. The script continuously makes calls to a specified phone number, waits for 30 seconds, then repeats the call. Please note that this script does not currently check the call status, and will continue making calls indefinitely until manually stopped. As such, it may not function as intended in all use cases or environments. Adjustments may be necessary to achieve the desired functionality.
